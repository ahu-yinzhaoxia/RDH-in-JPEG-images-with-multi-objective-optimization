## Abstract
Among various methods of reversible data hiding (RDH) in JPEG images, only rate-distortion, i.e. the image quality with given payload, is taken into consideration during algorithm designing. However, file size expansion is another important evaluation metric for JPEG RDH methods. Based on this situation, we propose a JPEG RDH method considering both the rate-distortion and the file size expansion at the same time while designing the algorithm. The multi-objective optimization strategy is utilized to realize the balance of the two objectives. Specifically, the cover signal is divided into several nonoverlapping parts firstly, and after that, the embedding costs of each part are calculated. Next, the optimized combination of parts for embedding data is gained by multi-objective optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of rate-distortion and file size expansion performance.

## 摘要
在JPEG图像中可逆数据隐藏（RDH）的各种方法中，在算法设计过程中仅考虑速率失真，即具有给定有效负载的图像质量。 但是，文件大小扩展是JPEG RDH方法的另一个重要评估指标。 针对这种情况，在设计算法的同时，提出了同时考虑速率失真和文件扩展的JPEG RDH方法。 利用多目标优化策略来实现两个目标的平衡。 具体地，首先将覆盖信号分为几个不重叠的部分，然后，计算每个部分的嵌入成本。 接下来，通过多目标优化获得用于嵌入数据的零件的优化组合。 实验结果表明，所提出的算法在速率失真和文件大小扩展性能方面均优于最新方法。
